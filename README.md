# ClauseWise â€“ Legal Document Analyzer (Demo)

Production-style React + TypeScript app that demonstrates your ClauseWise concept:
- Multilingual OCR + NLP (simulated) using IBM Watson + Granite terminology
- Clause extraction & classification with risk/compliance hints
- Regulatory monitoring feed
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Clean legal-grade UI with Tailwind

> This repo is frontend-only and uses mocked services in `src/services/ai.ts` so you can run it locally and showcase the UX.
> You can later connect real IBM watsonx/Granite + RAG backends by swapping those functions.

## Tech
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- React Router
- React Query
- d3 for tiny graph
